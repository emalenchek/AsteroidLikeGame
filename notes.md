TODO:

- When asteroid is destroyed
    - spawn 4 little baby asteroids
    that are smaller
    - check to see if the asteroid is large enough to care about collision (scoring/color/etc)
- Asteroid rotation
- refine movement


STRETCH:
- different weapon and ship types
- enemies other than asteroids
- Adding additional effects for destroyed player and asteroids
- Sound effects
- For "mine/honing" power up reset adjust end location for all active projectiles to redirect to homing target
